        "- In Logistic Regression, the model doesn't output \"0\" or \"1\" directly. It outputs a continuous value between 0 and 1, which we interpret as the probability that the input $x_i$ belongs to the \"positive\" class ($y=1$).\n",
        "- To do this, we use an activation on top of our linear model(from linear regression)\n",

If you have three data points where the first two are $1$ and the last is $0$, the likelihood is:$$L(\\beta) = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot (1 - p_3)$$If the model is \"good,\" all these numbers will be close to $1$, making the total product high.
